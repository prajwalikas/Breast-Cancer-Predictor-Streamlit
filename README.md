# Breast Cancer Predictor 
# Overview
The Breast Cancer Predictor is a machine learning project that classifies breast cancer diagnoses as benign or malignant. Built using Python in VS Code, It uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) from scikit-learn.
. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementing classification models like Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were applied to enhance accuracy, with visualizations aiding feature analysis and interpretability.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, providing a simple tool for early detection and aiding informed decision-making.
